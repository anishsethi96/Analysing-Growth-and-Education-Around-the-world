# Analysis-of-Global-Education-and-Growth-Trends

## Abstract
Educating the youth of a nation is the most important factor when it comes to their growth. This project analyses data from the United Nations about Education, Growth and Gross Value added by sectors so show a correlation between the same. I feel that education and GDP are always positively correlated because with an increase in the level of education, more people find employment and since employers are ready to provide highly specialized jobs with a high pay, the spending or consumption increases and since consumption increases, so does Gross Domestic Product.
This analysis intends to find the effects of primary, secondary and tertiary education on growth, specifically the GDP and the individual GVA added by sectors and represent them visually. The analysis is done on R Studio and the Exploratory data analysis is shown in the form of bar plots, heatmaps, stacked plots and multiple scatter and area graphs. The data had some missing values which were cleaned and needed uniformity of format before the analysis was done. This analysis depicts the relation between education and growth for regions around the world and certain countries of interest (e.g. United States of America, India, China, Greece, and Syria). A Linear model was applied to predict the GDP and growth of certain countries in the future based on the enrollments in tertiary school and the changing value added by sectors. KNN Classification was done on the countries to classify them into 3 broad categories of Low, Average and High GDP based on the linear model.
